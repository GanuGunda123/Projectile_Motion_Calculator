Description:

A simple Program used to calculate the distance travelled and time it takes a projectile that is launched with some intial velocity, at some angle, with some intial height. User enters intial velocity, intial height, and angle it is launched at.



What I Learned:

What I learned from creating this program is how to implement basic object-oritented programming in my programs. In this program I created a simple "Projectile" object which was used  to model the user's projectile and from there make the necessry calculations.
